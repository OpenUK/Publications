: NOTE: Shared on Github

A reader should gain an understanding of the existing policies and documents published by UK & EU Government and the NHS to place in to context the recommendations in the following sections and direction of the implementation manual. It is also of benefit to understand the intent of the Apperta Foundation to enable better health care in the UK by embracing new models of acquisition and implementation of digital technology.

Tallinn eGovernment Declaration signed October 2017 - Interoperability by default  Here, nations will drive the use of open standards and open-source technology. The aim will be to “make ICT solutions owned by or developed for the public administrations more readily available for reuse in private sector and civil society”.

Differences between https://ohie.org/shared-health-record/ and NHS - larger systems need more layers, standards and protocols to be distributed. This is a challenge for the current suppliers but is technically feasible with the right organised efforts

### Defining an Open Platform

- Apperta Foundation, November 2017

https://community.apperta.org/forums/905251-request-for-comment/suggestions/32077336-defining-an-open-platform

Mr Bill Aylward MA MB BChir FRCS FRCOphth MD Chair Apperta Foundation November 2017
Dr Rebecca Wassall PhD CEO Apperta Clinical Lecturer / StR in Special Care Dentistry Newcastle University

> "Open platforms supporting 12 million patients already exist"

The open platforms approach is vendor and technology neutral, eliminates lock-in, facilitates innovation and competition, and forces vendors to compete on quality, value, and service

> Recommendation 6.	 Adopt and support the development of open source components towards a reference implementation of an open platform to stimulate the global ecosystem

### Peter Reid commented  ·  January 9, 2018 2:44 AM

A very interesting document with many useful links. However I did find it quite hard going on first reading. I found that I gained a fuller understanding when I created a simple set of slides in PowerPoint, as if I had the job of presenting this document to interested parties. The following is a link to these slides in my dropbox, in case they help someone else:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/dva2izwux6hbdo6/Apperta_Defining_an_Open_Platform_SP_PR.pptx?dl=0
In addition, I found several typos in the document, which I've marked up in case the document is to be revised. Here's a link to my marked-up copy:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/ea6uc61yhjiszq0/Apperta_Defining_an_Open_Platform_SP_PR.pdf?dl=0

Why an Open Platform – Problems?
Industry-standard platforms stimulate growth:
reduced risks, known solutions, ready-made champions
Platform ownership?
proprietary platforms shown to fail, market growth needs shared/open platforms

Key recommendations - Nurse involvement in technology solutions - Clinicians need to be involved in developing technology solutions.

The roundtable found that the best technology implementations followed an approach where the technology provider was, at the outset, willing to listen to the challenges faced at the frontline and have the flexibility to work with NHS staff.
In addition, the best technology was not dependent on a particular platform or device. This echoes the recommendations made by Health Education England in Barriers to Access for Technology Enhanced Learning 9 . “Where possible, any newly commissioned products should be developed so that they are device independent, i.e. working responsively across multiple devices, platforms and manufacturers,” it says.
One nurse who works in mental health highlighted the success of an app that enables therapeutic observations to be carried out on the move and the results fed back into the electronic patient record in real-time. Therapeutic observations in mental health can take place every five minutes, fifteen minutes or every half an hour depending on the client.

5) Interoperability by default

We will in our countries:

* enhance the re-use of emerging joint solutions under the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) programme or other common frameworks - in particular eID, eSignature, eDelivery, eProcurement and eInvoicing - and promote their implementation in more domains, while avoiding sectoral duplication of service infrastructures;
* make more use of open source solutions and/or open standards when (re)building ICT systems and solutions (among else, to avoid vendor lock-ins), including those developed and/or promoted by EU programmes for interoperability and standardisation, such as ISA2;
* make ICT solutions owned by or developed for the public administrations more readily available for reuse in private sector and civil society, for example, by developing and publishing terms and conditions on how third parties may reuse the solutions.

We call upon:

* the EU institutions to implement the European Interoperability Framework and the Interoperability Action Plan (including within all Commission services), especially for cross-border services within the Single Market – by the end of 2021;
* the Commission to discuss cross-border interoperability principles and work to reach relevant agreements with global partners, especially the eIDAS framework for global interoperability and mutual recognition of electronic identities and trust services;
* the Commission , building on the Council Conclusions on mainstreaming digital solutions and technologies in EU development policy, to submit proposals on how to fully integrate digital considerations into the EU’s external development policy support instruments, to ensure interoperability with EU frameworks and standards when third countries make investments to digital infrastructure and services with EU assistance – by the end of 2019;
* the Commission to consider strengthening the requirements for use of open source solutions and standards when (re)building of ICT systems and solutions takes place with EU funding, including by an appropriate open licence policy – by 2020. 

### Gov policy

UK Technology code of practice - lots of work has been done, well thought out, lots of effort, good point of reference

- Cabinet Office: start with user need
- Open Source gov guidelines / toolkit
- Open Standards policies

### Technology Code of Practice 

Updated 26 February 2018
The Technology Code of Practice is a set of criteria to help government design, build and buy better technology. It’s used as a cross-government agreed standard in the spend control process.

3. Be open and use open source
Publish your code and use open source to improve transparency, flexibility and accountability. 

https://www.gov.uk/guidance/be-open-and-use-open-source
How using open source will help your programme
Give equal consideration to open source software when you choose technology.
Your technology project or programme could benefit from:
    solving common problems with readily available open source technology
    more time and resource for customised solutions to solve the rare or unique problems
    lower implementation and running costs
Be aware that open source software is not completely free, so take into account the total cost of migrating, including exit and transition costs.

### Digital Service Standard

https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/make-all-new-source-code-open
 8. Make all new source code open
Make all new source code open and reusable, and publish it under appropriate licences (or provide a convincing explanation as to why this can't be done for specific subsets of the source code).

### Nonadoption study

> Beyond Adoption: A New Framework for Theorizing and Evaluating Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability of Health and Care Technologies

Published 01/11/2017
https://www.jmir.org/2017/11/e367

This study explores challenges to digital technology projects and identifies many where investment has been made but in many cases, no tangeable result.

Recommends the NASSS framework to assist with prediction of a likely project success or otherwise.
> identified technology barriers, patient barriers, staff barriers, team barriers, business and financial barriers, and governance and regulatory barriers 
> dynamic interaction between factors therefore more complex, the less likely chance of success.

Consider how very large scale digital projects operate, such as the Internet, small teams work on an individual item and use commonly agreed interfaces to communicate. Therefore each project is more likely to succeeded even if the initial project fails as another team are able to understand the full scope of the project, and understand communications.

The report makes no mention of Open Source, Open Standards or Open Platforms, and if these could directly impact the result.
